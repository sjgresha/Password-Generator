# Password-Generator

## Description
I have made a password generator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. When the user opens the application they will be prompted with questions, asking if they would like to use lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters, and how long they wish the password to be. They user will answer the questions with their desired options and a new password will appear.
